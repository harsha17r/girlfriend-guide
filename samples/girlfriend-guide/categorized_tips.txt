Chapter 1 : INTEL GATHERING 

#1
Know her like a book. Favorite animal, color (hex code too), birthday, all her "firsts." Store it. Remember it.

#2
Notice the small things. If she asks, "Do you notice anything?" Say her hair. It's always the hair.

#3
Ask her favorite flower. Type and color both matter. She'll notice...

#19
Screenshot conversations where she mentions things she wants. Your future self will thank you when gift occasions arise.

Chapter 2 : Decoding the girlfriend language

#4
When she vents ‚Äî don't fix. Listen first. Sometimes she just needs a witness, not a mechanic.

#5
Gossip is sacred. React like it's breaking news. Get invested. Be her co-conspirator.

#6
Never answer "Do I look fat?" with a pause. The answer is "No." Say it fast. Mean it. Don't look down.

#7
Instagram stories are not optional. React. Reply. Engage. It matters more than you think.

#18
Do whatever you want' is not permission. It's a trap. Abort mission.

Chapter 3 : THE BOYFRIEND UPGRADE MANUAL
#8
Flowers aren't seasonal. Don't wait for Valentine's Day. Get her roses on a random Tuesday. Bonus points for handwritten love notes.

#9
Dress like you tried. No "lazy day" fits on date night. Show you care through effort.

#10
Be a gentleman. Open doors. Carry the bag. Act right.

#11
Pay the bill. Always. She knows you will. Don't prove her wrong.

#12
Learn to cook. Master her comfort meal. Surprise dinners hit different when you made them yourself.

Chapter 4 : Non negotiable protocols

#13
Apologize first (gaslight yourself). Even if you think you're right. Especially then. She's right. End of discussion.

#14
Period protocol: Be useful. Stock her favorite comfort snacks. Bring them without being asked. Don't ask if she's PMSing ‚Äî just know.

#16
She gets the window seat. Plane, bus, train, restaurant booth ‚Äî it's hers. Always.

#17
Hoodie = shared property. Carry one.  It's not for you. It was never for you.
