I mostly took it as a joke and pretended to make notes in Google Notes. Later, they actually asked for the list to share with their boyfriends, which gave me the idea for a fun weekend project that had been on my to-do list for a while.

            In summer 2025, I brought some Figma designs to life with code. I experimented with new AI tools, played with visuals in Unicorn Studio and ChatGPT, spent time on fonts, and polished the copy with Perplexity. This is what came out.
